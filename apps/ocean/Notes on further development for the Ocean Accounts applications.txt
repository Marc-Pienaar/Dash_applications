The applications that run from the ocean accounts Dash app are currently set to embed within an ESRI app that was developed for the ocean accounts project website.
the website is being developed by Erika Brown erikabrown.gissa@gmail.com. she has some ideas about how she wants the information in these Dash apps to be displayed on the website,
Currently, the only work that needs to happen is that the download button needs to be removed from the Dash app.
Future work may include adding styling or additional data to the existing app.
